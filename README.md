# Nesting_Software_and_Automated_Marker

### Abstract:
   In the 21st century, we make extensive use of
plywood, steel sheets and aluminum sheets in our day to day
life for various purpose but most of the times we need these
materials in rectangular shapes, and we have to cut out them
from rectangular-shaped sheets.
We have developed a robot that can automatically optimize
rectangular shapes and fit them into the minimum area so that
the area wastage is minimum consequently the material wastage
is minimized.
